# steve-run

## Overview

Steve runs in an infinite hallway of Facebook's headquarters, nimbly dodging Mark Zuckerberg and every other Facebook-related thing.

With simple keyboard controls, a player can easily immerse themselves into an entertaining and amusing infinite runner game. Additionally, with a few downloads and a bit of programming knowledge, anyone can modify this code into whatever theme they want.

Steve Run was inspired by the Chrome browser game, Dino Run. A good implementation can be found at this GitHub repo: [https://github.com/codewmax/chrome-dinosaur](https://github.com/codewmax/chrome-dinosaur).

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

1. If you haven't already, **download and install Git Bash** onto your laptop. This can be done at this link: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Clone the project**. You can clone repositories with `git clone <url>`. In this case, you'd want to run `$ git clone https://github.com/olincollege/steve-run`in your terminal window, in a location within your computer you will remember.

3. **Make sure you have Python installed**. The installation can be found here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Note that this game was coded in Python 3.9.7.

4. **Make sure you have Pygame installed**. This game relies heavily on Pygame modules. You should be able to run `$ pip install pygame`, but for more detailed instructions, follow the link: [https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

5. **Open the cloned repository** in an IDE that you prefer. VS Code is a good option, or if you want a browser version to forego downloads, try making a [https://replit.com/](Replit) account and running the project through there.

6. If you want to, **run some unit tests**. Install pytest with `$ pip install pytest`. In the command line, navigate into the repository folder using `$ cd <location of repository>`, run `$ python`, then run `>>> pytest`.

### Dependencies

As in the above instructions, this project has one dependency, Pygame. Again, the download instructions can be found here: [https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

### Usage

This game runs perfectly on its own, if everything in the repository is downloaded.

That being said, Steve Run can serve as a baseline for many customized games. It is broad enough that it can be built upon into various directions, or the images could simply be changed to offer a different atmosphere. Feel free to clone and alter this repository on local devices.

## Playing the Game

### Controls

The controls for this game are very basic. The Up Arrow and Space Bar cause the character to jump, and the Down Arrow and Left Shift cause the character to duck. To start/restart games, press any key (as prompted).
